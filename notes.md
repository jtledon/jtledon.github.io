# This is a page to reference for things I want to include on my website

## Design Changes
* My logo currently has gaps like found in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGHlAS7AccY). I want to change it to old schematic designs where the wires are big loops jumping over each other, like this ![non-connectede wire](ReferenceImagesAndInspiration/jumped_non-connected_wires.jpg)
Could also do something terminal based with "> JasonLedon" and make it look like prompt with green font
* Make it responsive to different media sizes (If the screen size is too small, switch to icons only)
* Website should match the design of my resume

## Considerations
* Should I use Django, React, or some other sort of framework?
* Should I code all of these tools in python or javascript

## Pages
### Work Experience
* Logos of all of the places ive worked (all the even ones on the left side, all the odd ones on the right side) ![reference layout](ReferenceImagesAndInspiration/WorkExperienceLayout.png)
### Certifications
* Link to SW certification center
* Display all certification for solidworks, mastercam, engineering
* Link to the various youngest CSWE articles under the expect cert
* include QR codes for verificaton
### Home
* Resume preview (include download button)
### Online Tools
* FSM/Tree generator like the one seen [here](https://madebyevan.com/fsm/)
* HEX/Binary/Octal/Decimal addition/subtraction/multiplicaton/division calculator where you can specify a bit-width. It will indicate if it overflowed, underflowed, etc. Should also indicate if using 2s complement
* CSS playgound. A bunch of default css that you can view the text for and modify it and see it update real time. Example in "Old/html/html_previewer.html"
### Projects
* Rapid prototyping designs
